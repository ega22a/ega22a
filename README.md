# ðŸ‘‹ Well, hello there!
It's me, your friendly neighborhood Repiev George, or should I say, Repiev Egor Denisovitch, in Russian. I am a Software Engineer and Teacher at [Nizhny Tagil College of Trade and Economics](https://nttek.ru).

# ðŸ¥· Who am I?
I like to think of myself as a programming ninja, slicing through code like a samurai. My weapons of choice include PHP, Python, and JavaScript, and I use them to craft digital masterpieces that would make Michelangelo weep.

# ðŸ’© Additional about me...
You can find some of my stunning creations in [my repository](https://github.com/ega22a). I'm also a skilled practitioner of [Laravel](https://laravel.com) & [Orchid Platform](https://orchid.software) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), among other frameworks and libraries.

# ðŸŽ“ About my workplace and your Alma Mater

Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you about the Nizhny Tagil College of Trade and Economics, the greatest institution of learning since the dawn of time! And what makes us so great, you ask? Well, it's simple â€“ we have the most awesome specialty in information systems and programming!

At our college, we take databases seriously. We study them like Sherlock Holmes investigates a crime scene â€“ with a keen eye for detail and a thirst for knowledge. We learn to design and implement databases, optimize their performance, and secure them from any pesky cybercriminals trying to cause trouble.

But that's not all! We also get our hands dirty with Python, PHP, and JavaScript. We develop web applications that are so slick and smooth, they make butter jealous. We use the latest and greatest frameworks like [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), and [Orchid Platform](https://orchid.software), to create web applications that are not only beautiful but also functional and scalable.

And let me tell you, we take learning seriously at our college. We don't just teach you how to write code, we teach you how to think like a programmer. We want you to be able to solve any coding challenge that comes your way, from fixing a bug to building a full-fledged web application.

But don't worry, it's not all work and no play at our college. We like to have fun too! We organize coding competitions, hackathons, and other fun events to keep our students engaged and motivated.

So, if you want to become a coding superstar, come join us at the Nizhnetagilsky College of Trade and Economics. We'll give you the knowledge and skills you need to conquer the world of programming and have a blast while doing it!

# ðŸ«µ About YOU!
But enough about me, let's talk about you. Do you want to learn how to program well, think outside the box, and look for an automated approach to everything? Then your way to our college!

And don't worry, I'm not one of those stuffy, uptight developers who take themselves too seriously. I like to have fun, and I'm always up for a good joke or a laugh. So, if you want to chat, hit me up on [email](mailto:egor.repiev@gmail.com) or [Telegram](https://ega22a.t.me). Let's create something amazing together!
